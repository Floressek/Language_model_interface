# Advanced Interactive Chat Interface with Ollama Language Models

## Overview
This advanced Python project develops a sophisticated chat interface, enabling dynamic interaction with a variety of Ollama language models through a user-friendly, dark-themed GUI built using tkinter. Designed for flexibility and ease of use, it allows users to query different language models in real-time, offering functionalities to manage and document conversations effectively.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Language Model Support:** Engage with a diverse array of models including `llama2`, `mistral`, `llama2:13b`, `llama2-uncensored`, `llava`, `codellama:34b`, `deepseek-coder:33b`, `sqlcoder`, each accessible via specific commands like `ollama run <model_name>`.
2. **Real-Time Chat Interaction:** Utilizes threading for asynchronous communication, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
3. **Enhanced GUI Customization:** Features a customizable dark mode interface, designed to minimize eye strain and improve text readability.
4. **Conversation Flow Control:** Offers detailed control over chat interactions, including options to start, stop, clear, and save conversations as markdown files for easy sharing and reviewing.
5. **Dynamic Input Adjustment:** Implements an adaptive text entry box that adjusts its size based on the user's input, enhancing overall usability.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Recommended RAM: 16GB and a decent GPU.

### Install Ollama:
Before running the chat interface, install the ollama library using pip:
```
pip install ollama
```

### Clone the Repository:
Download the project files to your local machine.

### Launch the Application:
